# poker-game

A Kotlin/JS-based browser-only poker game whose clients communicate via WebRTC.

Usage of the WebRTC protocol is abstracted by [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/),
which also provides the default signaling server.

The app is based on React.

A live preview is available at http://home.in.tum.de/~koch/play-poker/
